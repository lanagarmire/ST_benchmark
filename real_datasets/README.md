This folder contains the real datasets used in the benchmark analysis project.

Each dataset file in ".RData" format has been formatted to work with the rest of the scripts for the benchmark project. 

All the real datasets used in the project were obtained from previous open access research in the field of spatial transcriptomics. For the original raw datasets, see the following links:
